pytle
=====

A gui to use python/logo with feature to record macro


Tested in windows/linux-ubuntu



to run


python pytle.py






it was built in late 2012 when i was trying to learn Tkinter and python
so obviously my coding style is mostly procedure based and many mistakes in about section i have been lazy/busy to change it as i am working on other projects.
also interface is minimal.
